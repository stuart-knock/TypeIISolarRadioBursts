   This code calculates the predicted dynamic spectra for a type II  
   radio burst from the solar corona and interplanetary medium. The 
   program is written in Fortran 90, formatted output is written to 
   file with plotting of that output performed by two IDL routines. 
   
   Run time can be long, the example is relatively short with a run 
   time of about 30 minutes, with full runs (corona to 1AU) typically 
   taking a couple of days on a current desktop machine 
   (~2GHz Pentium/AMD). 
   
   The data output can also be large. Even the short example produces 
   ~42M of .dat files.

 #Quick Start Guide: 
 
   compile Dynamic_Spectra.f90 
 
     AMD[zeus, sgt, lenin, castor]: lf95 --tpp --prefetch 2 -o Dynamic_Spectra.e Dynamic_Spectra.f90

     P4[loki, iolaus, arjuna, ganesh, perseus, odysseus]: lf95 --tp4 -o Dynamic_Spectra.e Dynamic_Spectra.f90

     XEON[shakti]:lf95 --tp4 -o Dynamic_Spectra.e Dynamic_Spectra.f90

     [myrmidon]:f90 -fast [-xarch=v9b (64bit including highest level optimisation for myrmidon chips and operating system)] -o Dynamic_Spectra.e Dynamic_Spectra.f90

   Run the code using the example input file by typing 
     
     Dynamic_Spectra.e

   at a command line. The program uses input from Dynamic_Spectra.input 
   if it can find it otherwise it uses default values hard coded into 
   the subroutine Initialise_Global. The example Dynamic_Spectra.input 
   file takes about 30 minutes on a ~2GHz P4/Athlon and produces about
   42MB of .dat files. 
   
   Once the code has finished running, change into the IDL/ directory 
   and run the IDL routines to plot the output.
